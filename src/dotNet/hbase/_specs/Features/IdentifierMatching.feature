Feature: Identifier Matching
  In order to determine whether two identifiers are similar
  As an hbase-client consumer
  I want to compare full identifiers with partial ones and get predictable results

Scenario: Successful Match; Table Only
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table |
    | test  |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should have succeeded

Scenario: Failed Match; Table Only
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table |
    | foo   |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should not have succeeded

Scenario: Successful Match; Table and Row
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  |
    | test  | row1 |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should have succeeded

Scenario: Failed Match; Table and Row
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row |
    | test  | foo |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should not have succeeded

Scenario: Successful Match; Table, Row, and Column
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  |
    | test  | row1 | column1 |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should have succeeded

Scenario: Failed Match; Table, Row, and Column
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column |
    | test  | row1 | foo    |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should not have succeeded

Scenario: Successful Match; Table, Row, Column, and Qualifier
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should have succeeded

Scenario: Failed Match; Table, Row, Column, and Qualifier
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | foo       |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should not have succeeded

Scenario: Successful Match; Table, Row, Column, Qualifier, and Timestamp
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should have succeeded

Scenario: Failed Match; Table, Row, Column, Qualifier, and Timestamp
  Given I have an identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 100       |
  And I have a second identifier consisting of the following values:
    | table | row  | column  | qualifier  | timestamp |
    | test  | row1 | column1 | qualifier1 | 200       |
  When I match the second identifier to the first one
  Then the identifier match should not have succeeded
